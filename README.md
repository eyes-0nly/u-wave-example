# üWave Example

This is an example of a üWave web application using [u-wave-http-api][http-api] and
[u-wave-web][web]. It's very barebones—for a more advanced example, check out [wlk.yt][wlk.yt].
wlk.yt includes emoji and integrates with the https://hub.u-wave.net announce server.

Try it by running:

```shell
npm install
# Pick a port you like! :)
PORT=8080 npm start
```

Then open http://localhost:8080.
